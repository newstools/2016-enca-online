HARARE - Former Zimbabwean Vice President Joice Mujuru is seeking to make amends for the misrule she has been part of for over 30 years. Many believed Mujuru would be the natural choice to succeed the aging Zimbabwean leader after being made the youngest cabinet minister in the first post-independence administration. But in 2014 Mujuru was accused of attempting to unseat and possibly assassinate President Robert Mugabe and was sacked along with eight other cabinet ministers. After her ousting, Mujuru denied the allegations and stated the reason that she was dismissed because she had spoken out against corruption in the governing party “Up to now, we wake up each day and look at each other, with Rugare Gumbo, Dydimus Mutasa, and Dzikamai Mavhaire, and ask ourselves why we have not been arrested for attempted murder and treason. We have not been intercepted despite the numerous roadblocks that we encounter on our roads every day,” she said. She said they had decided to remain silent and not respond to the allegations, “because no docket can be opened for remaining silent”. Mujuru began her own political party called Zimbabwe People First in February after signalling her intention to form one last year by releasing a manifesto opposing Mugabe's key policies including indigenisation laws that compel foreign firms to cede majority stakes to locals.
