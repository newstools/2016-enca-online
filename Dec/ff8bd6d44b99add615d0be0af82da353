JOHANNESBURG – Former Defence Minister Charles Nqakula has spoken out about the crisis at the SABC. Nqakula, current Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula's husband, has written an open letter addressed to one of the SABC8, Lukhanyo Calata. READ: SABC8 paints grim picture "You reminded me of your father, Fort when you courageously challenged what you saw as a wrong," Nqakula said. Fort Calata was part of a group of anti-apartheid activists known as the Cradock Four. Nqakula applauded journalist Calata and his colleagues for their bravery displayed before MPs. The eight journalists testified before Parliament's ad hoc committee probing the fitness of the public broadcaster's board to hold office. The ANC veteran and former journalist also apologised for not speaking out earlier. He added that troubles at the SABC point to divisions within the governing party and urged party members to speak out in order to protect democracy. Nqakula spoke to eNCA about the letter. eNCA
