JOHANNESBURG - Former Gauteng education MEC Mary Metcalfe says there is merit in the Education Department's decision to allow children in grades 7 - 9 to pass the year with 20 percent. According to a circular, released by the department on 1 December, children in those grades who obtained 20 percent but who passed all other subjects would be allowed to progress to the next year. Many took to social media to express outrage at what they termed as the dumbing down of maths and children in South Africa. A maths pass mark of 20% to keep in line with the presidential maths literacy But Metcalfe said those who voiced their anger didn't understand why the decision was made. "It's [the circular] saying that given in grade 10, learners are going to choose between doing maths lit and maths ... learners in previous grades shouldn’t be held back because they’re failing maths." She said it was clear that those children who couldn't cope with maths would have to resort to doing maths literacy in grade 10. "Of course the underlying problem is that as a country we’re not doing well in maths and that requires interventions right from foundation phase to build the opportunity to learn maths. Many of the learners would succeed if they had better access to [learning] materials." Metcalfe admitted that teachers would ultimately feel the effects of having children in their classes who had passed with 20 percent. "The real challenge is going to be for teachers in grade 8 and 9 who will have more learners in their class who were not able to cope with the previous year’s work. You’ll have a wider range of performance in the class and that’s always more challenging for teachers to have more students who do well … and some who aren’t able to keep up."
