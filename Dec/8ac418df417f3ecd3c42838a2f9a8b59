CAPE TOWN -Â 2016 saw another year of fierce battles between opposition parties in Parliament. Watch clips from highlights of the year in this timeline. The Economic Freedom Fighters set the tone by putting state capture on the agenda early on, with their chants of "Zupta must fall" during President Jacob Zuma's State of the Nation address. From then on Parliament deteriorated into a number of physical clashes, inside and outside the National Assembly and several failed motions of no confidence. The President himself lost patience with all the drama and complained about verbal abuse, threatening to stop coming to Parliament until opposition MPs stop hurling insults at him. With the political parties gearing up for the 2019 national general elections, the battle for power will no doubt be played out in the national assembly in 2017, with opposition parties continuing to try and bring down the governing party.
