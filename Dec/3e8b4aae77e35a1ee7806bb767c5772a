JOHANNESBURG – Nigeria has successfully circumvented US sanctions against the country by purchasing warplanes and helicopters from Russia and Pakistan. Nigeria’s Chief of Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar, confirming that Abuja was awaiting the arrival of the planes, said the purchase was aimed at boosting the military in its efforts to end the insurgency by militant Islamists in the north and oil militants in the south. Despite appeals from President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, the US has refused to lift its ban on the sale of weapons to Nigeria because of the military’s alleged poor human rights record, the BBC reported on Monday.

Sometimes arm procurement is shrouded in a lot of politics. Unfortunately, I’m not a politician, so I cannot be able to say much on that. But what I can tell you is that right now as I speak to you, we are expecting the Pakistani Chief of Air Staff in Nigeria soon,” he added. “Pakistan has accepted to sell 10 trainer airplanes. And that is why the Pakistan Chief of Air Staff is coming for the induction ceremony which is going to take place in Kaduna. “We are really getting support from many countries. Similarly, we have trained so many people in Pakistan, China. “In the US, we have pilots that are training right now. We have other pilots that have just finished training from the United Kingdom. We have additional pilots that are training in South Africa,” Abubakar added. African News Agency
