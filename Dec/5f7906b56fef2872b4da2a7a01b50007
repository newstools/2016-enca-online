JOHANNESBURG - The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has issued yet another statement clarifying its position on the 20-percent mathematics pass rate. It says there's been a misunderstanding. Officials say the department would only condone a poor mathematics pass rate on condition pupils passed all their other subjects. It says it’s unfair that pupils often pass subjects, some with distinctions, but they end up being made to fail the entire year because they fail to get the required 40-percent pass-mark for mathematics in Grades 7 to 9, when it is a compulsory subject.

"Now in addition to passing your two language subjects you have to pass home language at 50% and you have to pass mathematics. INFOGRAPHIC: Matric results over the past few years "In essence what the policy states is that even if you pass all of your other subjects with distinctions, but got less than 40% for mathematics you failed the year." The DBE has decided to take the policy under review. As such, an interim decision has been taken to "condone those who did not meet the 40% criteria in Mathematics to the next grade if the met all other pass requirements and obtained more than 20% in mathematics."
