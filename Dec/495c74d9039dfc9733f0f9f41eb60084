LIMPOPO - Self-professed prophet, Lethebo Rabalago’s days of spraying Doom at congregants, are numbered. The Limpopo Health Department has obtained an interdict, preventing him from spraying insecticide at churchgoers. Rabalago has been ordered to appear in court next month, to provide reasons the interdict should not be made final. Derick Kganyago, Limpopo Health Department spokesperson, said, “Our wish if you remember, was to approach him directly to come forward so that we could test his psychiatric status but he is not complying."
