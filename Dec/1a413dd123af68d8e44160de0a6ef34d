SOWETO â€“ The African National Congress will use its anniversary celebrations in January to renew vows to its supporters. The governing party would mark 105 years at Orlando Stadium in Soweto and anticipates that thousands would attend the event. "With all that we have gone through we are not stagnant and at the same time we are not ignorant of what around us and what is important for us is the message and commitment," said organiser Fikile Mbalula on Wednesday. #ANC's Fikile Mbalula : We are hoping to fill up this stadium.
