PRETORIA - The remains of a South African soldier killed in the DRC will be handed over to his family on Friday. A ceremonial parade is expected to be held at Air Force Base Waterkloof. Moalosi Albert Mokhothu died during a gun battle with rebels earlier this month. He served as a member of a United Nations Stabilisation Mission. The SANDF says Mokhothu was a hero who paid the ultimate price while contributing to peace on the continent. His name will be inscribed on a wall of remembrance. eNCA
