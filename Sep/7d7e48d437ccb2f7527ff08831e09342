JOHANNESBURG – Sunday was a sad day for the South African music industry. READ: Kwaito luminary, Mandoza dead at 38 I think the weather felt it as we all woke up to a miserably cold spring day, in stark contrast to the bright hot weather we've experienced in Johannesburg this week, yet September 18, 2016 chose to bring light drizzles and the sad news of Mandoza's death. It was shocking to the system but also shrouded with confused speculation as users of social media tried to verify whether or not the news was accurate, because "black twitter" had already killed him off two days previously. In the mid afternoon, the news was confirmed… Mandoza had on Sunday morning. The artist was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour and has been undergoing treatment since last year. Mandoza was born in the Zola South section of Soweto, where he shared a house with his mother, his grandparents and two sisters. Like many boys growing up in the streets of Zola, Mandoza was drawn to crime at an early age.  When he was 16 years old he was sent to Diepkloof prison for a year and a half, after stealing a car. That became a wake-up call for the young Mandoza. Soon after his release from prison, Mandoza formed the group Chiskopalong with three childhood friends, S’bu, Siphiwe and Sizwe who he knew from gymnastics. Although Chiskop achieved some success, Mandoza launched his solo career. In 1999 he released the top-selling album 9II5 Zola South, for which he gained a 2000 FNB South African Music Awards Best Newcomer nomination.  He released the album Nkalakatha in 2000, which won multi-platinum status. The title track became a crossover hit and reached the top of the charts on both traditionally black and white radio stations. This album won the Best Kwaito Music Album category and the album's title track won the Song Of The Year category at the South African Music Awards in 2001. Mandoza also won in five of the 10 categories at the 2001 Metro Music Awards: Best Kwaito Artist, Best Male Vocalist, Best Album, Best Styled Artist and Song Of The Year. Finally, also in 2001, Mandoza won the Best Artist – Southern Africa category at the Kora All Africa Music Awards. Mandoza was voted 77th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004. The celebrated muso's life has not been without controversy but he will mostly be remembered for his music and his contribution to the building and recognition of kwaito music in South Africa.
