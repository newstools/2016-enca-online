CAPE TOWN – Two people have been arrested in Cape Town in connection with corruption in respects of fraudulent passports and permits, the directorate for priority crime investigation (Hawks) in the Western Cape said on Friday. An intelligence-led investigation by Hawks members, Northern Cape border security intelligence, and local criminal record centres netted two suspects aged 29 and 38 "for corruption relating to international fraudulent passports and permits", spokesman Captain Lloyd Ramovha said. "The two suspects, male and female, were apprehended at their respective homes in Goodwood and Maitland, Cape Town. It is alleged that they work in cahoots with unnamed immigration officials at the Springbok offices [in the Northern Cape]. "More than 70 passports and accompanying permits of different foreign countries, as well a combined R189,900 in cash were seized at their respective houses." The two were expected to appear at the Springbok Magistrate’s Court on Monday on charges relating to the Immigration Act, money laundering, and the Prevention Of Organised Crime Act, Ramovha said.
