DURBAN - Umlazi is one of the largest townships in South Africa and is home to over half a million people. It is a space plagued by poverty, unemployment and a range of social ills. But it is also a place with a strong sense of community. Having overcome the hardships of extreme poverty during apartheid’s volatile years, eNCA reporter Sgu Shangase takes a journey back to his old haunts. As a youngster, he suffered immense trauma as in-fighting between the Inkatha Freedom Party and the African National Congress raged in the area during the turbulent 1980’s and 1990’s. Engaging with family, friends and his former school principal, Sgu reflects on how much has changed in Umlazi since the dawn of the new South Africa.
