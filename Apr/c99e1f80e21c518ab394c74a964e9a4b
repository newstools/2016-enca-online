JOHANNESBURG - When I first heard the murmurings of a rumour that EFC Light Heavyweight Champion Norman 'Chef' Wessels was retiring from all Mixed Martial Arts competition, I knew I had to take a trip out to Fight Fit Militia (FFM) to establish the truth. What followed was one of the most candid interviews ever granted by the most popular and polarising figure in the history of the sport on the African Continent. During the interview, Wessels talks openly about his future, his approach to competition and the importance of fatherhood. In part two, he discusses cutting to middleweight and being a leader at FFM, as well as his relationship with the EFC and the possibility of fighting for the UFC.
