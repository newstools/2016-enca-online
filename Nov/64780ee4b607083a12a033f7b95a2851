JOHANNESBURG - Newly crowned sportswoman of the year Caster Semenya has lashed out directly at her critics for the first time. During her acceptance speech at the SA Sports Awards on Sunday night the Olympian didn’t mince her words. “They say she talks like a man, she walks like a man, she runs like a man… ‘tsek,” she quipped. Semenya's hyperandrogenism has made her the target of controversy over the years but she has always remained silent about the attacks.

Experts weighed in and the international media were relentless. READ: Five things to know about Caster Semenya She became one of the most talked about Olympic athletes.
