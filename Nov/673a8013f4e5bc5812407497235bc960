JOHANNESBURG â€“ A 1995 news report that shows protests at the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), has resurfaced. In it, the students are demanding the reinstatement of their fellow scholars and staff members who have been dismissed the previous year. The demonstration took place at the university's main administration building Senate House, after former vice Chancellor Robert Charlton said that the reinstatement of those dismissed, would not be possible. Students reportedly vandalised the campus by opening fire hoses, damaging bathrooms and overturning dustbins. ANC veteran Walter Sisulu and then Deputy Secretary General Cheryl Carolus, are also in the video. In 2016 history repeated itself when the #FeesMustFall protesters demonstrated on the same campus, this time for free education.
