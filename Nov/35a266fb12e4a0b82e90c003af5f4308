JOHANNESBURG – Footage emerged on Wednesday of two men, believed to be the bodyguards of Durban businessman Sibusiso Mpisane, venting their road-rage on another motorist. The video shows two smartly dressed men get out of their SUV and begin to harass and slap a man as he sits in a white sedan. The Mercury reported that Mpisane confirmed that the SUV was registered in his name and that he had urged the victim to take up the incident with the authorities. Mpisane reportedly said he did not condone such behaviour. eNCA.com's calls and emails seeking comment  went unanswered by Mpisane. In 2014, he and his wife, Shauwn, were accused of fraud and tax evasion, but the charges were withdrawn. READ: Mpisanes to have their assets returned eNCA
