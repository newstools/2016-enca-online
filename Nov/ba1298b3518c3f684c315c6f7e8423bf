PRETORIA - An AbaThembu chief has died, hours before the coronation of a new regent. Chief Daludumo Mtirara was found dead in his Pretoria home on Thursday night. He was the spokesperson of a faction of the royal family opposed to the crowning of the son of jailed AbaThembu King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo. Mtirara had instead backed the king's brother to act in his capacity. eNCA
