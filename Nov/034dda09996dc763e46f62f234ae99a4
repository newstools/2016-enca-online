HARARE – The imminent introduction of the so-called bond notes has sparked a mad rush to local banks as Zimbabweans withdraw their money, fearing hyperinflation. The cash-strapped Zimbabwean government is this week set to introduce the widely-condemned bond notes, evoking memories of the 2009 crisis which wiped people’s savings from banks following a world hyperinflation record of more than 231 million percent.

Several people interviewed in the capital Harare and Bulawayo, expressed renewed fears of hyperinflation. “We don’t trust this currency, which is being imposed on us by a desperate government. We would rather sleep in these long winding queues with the view to withdraw our hard earned cash before our savings are being wiped away,” said Shorai Munenzwa of Highfields, Harare. Mildred Chirambadare of Sunningdale, said she has been sleeping outside an ATM in the capital for two days in order to get her savings before the bond notes comes into effect. “I would rather keep my cash inside the house. In the previous hyperinflation, we were not reimbursed for our loss,” said Chirambadare. Sibongile Khumalo of Lobengula in Bulawayo said bond notes were a huge risk to their investments. “Very soon, my children will be out of school if I can’t act fast,” said Khumalo. Nomathemba Ncube of Matsheumhlope, also from Bulawayo, said the government had failed running the economy. “Our government is wicked. Removing my savings from banks before it’ s too late is the way to go,” added Ncube. Government and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) officials said they were aware of resistance to bond notes but insisted the notes would be introduced through gazetted statutory instruments.
