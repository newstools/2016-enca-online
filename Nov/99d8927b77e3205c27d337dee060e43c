GABORONE – The Namibian government has tabled a new land ownership bill that seeks to bar foreigners from owning agricultural, commercial and communal lands. The Land Bill of 2016, tabled in Parliament by lands minister Utoni Nujoma on Friday, proposed a raft of amendments to the Agricultural Commercial Land Reform Act of 1995 and the Communal Land Reform Act of 2002.

According to figures from the Ministry of Agriculture, 141 of the 281 foreigners who own prime land in Namibia are Germans. However, the bill does not propose to prevent foreigners from owning land in urban areas. African News Agency
