JOHANNESBURG – Fees Must Fall student leader Mcebo Dlamini has compared his time in prison to initiation school. Dlamini was released on R2,000 bail, after successfully appealing a lower court's decision to keep him behind bars. WATCH: Mcebo Dlamini granted bail “Prison to me was like initiation, I appreciated the opportunity that they gave me. When they took us to prison they thought they were breaking us, but they were anointing us (sic),” he said. The 32-year-old has called on Wits University to allow students who fail the current exams to rewrite. Dlamini reiterated the students’ demand for free, quality higher education. “The call for free education has never been so important that it is now, because if there was free education there would be no young people in Sun City. Even the old people that are there who are forced to commit crime to put food on the table. Our people are forced to be criminals because of the failed state.” His bail conditions prohibit him from disrupting campus activities. He also can't contact witnesses in the case. eNCA
