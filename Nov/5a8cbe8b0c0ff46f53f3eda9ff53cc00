PRETORIA - Sixteen University of Pretoria (UP) students arrested for contravening a court order have been released on bail. The students were arrested in Hatfield on Monday, after they picketed on campus. UP obtained an interdict forbidding demonstrations on university grounds, after academic activities were disrupted by a series of protests for free education. The arrested students claim to have been holding a night vigil for a slain UJ student. They say they were not protesting. They've been granted R1,000 bail eachÂ and are due back in court in January. eNCA
