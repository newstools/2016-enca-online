JOHANNESBURG – A planned march by University of Johannesburg (UJ) students was halted on Thursday following a misunderstanding about the notice between the police and the students. About 50 UJ students gathered at The Yard, the private student accommodation where BSc computer science and informatics student Kelvin Baloyi was shot dead by private police over the weekend. Baloyi, 21, was shot while attending a party. The students had sent a notice to the university and the police asking for permission to march to the Auckland Park campus. READ: Clashes continue on several campuses Police said that they received a notice saying that the students would march to the Bunting campus, which meant that the march could not continue. The students argued with the police who blocked them from continuing with their march. A legal services representative pleaded with the students to submit a new notice, stating that they would be going to the Auckland Park campus and reschedule the march to Friday. The group of students dispersed and gathered at a park opposite the Auckland Park campus, which was where the march was planned to end. African News Agency
