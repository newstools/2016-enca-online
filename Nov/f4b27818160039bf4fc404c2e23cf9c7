JOHANNESBURG - The Gupta family is continuing to challenge a decision by local banks to cut ties with their companies. The family wants the courts to force the Financial Intelligence Centre to release information on alleged dubious transactions. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan says the FIC has identified 72 unusual and suspicious transactions involving the family's business entities, amounting to R6.8-billion. Last month, Gordhan applied for an order to declare that he can't intervene. The Gupta family claim they're victims of a political game. The Gupta's family lawyer, Gert van der Merwe said, "You see why we need the information, is because we want to give good reasons and explanations for the transactions provided for in the application of the minister. We’ve said from the start that there’s no sinister transaction whatsoever nature in those transactions, on that list at least." WATCH: Gupta lawyer defends family transactions The Guptas' lawyer says they will show how all the transactions flagged as suspicious by the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) are in fact lawful. In October, the finance minister lodged a High Court application seeking an order that he not intervene in the banks’ decision to drop the Guptas as clients. Pravin Gordhan’s court papers revealed 72 dubious transactions over the past four years. In May this year, the FIC flagged the transaction from Optimum Mine’s tax-exempt rehabilitation trust. The funds are meant to be used to renew and redevelop mining land once a mine closes. But the Gupta family’s attorney says there's nothing wrong with this or any other transaction. eNCA
