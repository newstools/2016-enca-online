NEW YORK - 'Fifty Shades Darker' has been given an R rating. The 'Fifty Shades of Grey' sequel has been issued the rating by the Motion Picture Association of America due to the graphic sexual scenes between lead stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, who play lovers Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey. A statement released by the MPAA, says the scenes won't be appropriate for those under 17, due to the movie's "strong erotic sexual content, some graphic nudity and language". The first film also received the same rating in the US. The follow-up is set to be released on 10 February 2017 and Dakota and Jamie will be joined by many returning cast members including Rita Ora -- who plays Christian's sister Mia Grey -- Luke Grimes and Eloise Mumford One big change in the production of the upcoming hit, was the departure of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' director Sam Taylor-Johnson following her film -- based on E. L. James' book of the same name -- taking $571-million worldwide. Sam was replaced in the franchise by James Foley who has also helmed the third and final movie 'Fifty Shades Freed', which is due out in 2018. Previously sharing her thoughts on the new director, Dakota said: "There was a moment of being afraid, because I didn't know what it was going to be like. I had an experience with Sam and then that all went away. I think James is a talented filmmaker. How often do you get to reconvene with the same people and have a different spin?" - BangShowBiz
