CAIRO, Egypt - An Egyptian appeals court has overturned a death sentence handed down against ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in one of several trials since his 2013 overthrow, a judicial official said. The Court of Cassation ordered that Morsi be retried on the charges of participating in prison breaks and violence against policemen during the 2011 uprising which toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak. Five co-defendants, including the supreme guide of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, will also be retried. Egypt repeals Morsiâ€™s death sentence https://t.co/n7WrGNj30t AFP
