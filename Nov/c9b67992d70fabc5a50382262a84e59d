CAPE TOWN - A car plunged off the Hout Bay side of Chapman's Peak early on Monday morning, with the driver inside. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), emergency services and the police responded to witness reports of the fall, but could not see the vehicle from Chapman's Peak Drive. The NSRI Hout Bay duty crew launched the sea rescue craf, Albie Matthews, while Chapman's Peak Drive was closed to traffic while the rescue was conducted.

No one was inside the vehicle, but a 32-year-old man was found near the roadside. It is believed he had been ejected from the car as it rolled down the mountainside. "The man was found to be conscious and in a stable condition but suffering head injuries and cuts and bruises," Lambinon said. "The EMS/AMS Skymed rescue helicopter was dispatched by metro control. "EMS rescue paramedics descended to the scene from the roadway using high-angle safety ropes and rigging. The man was treated by rescue paramedics for his injuries and, in a stable condition, he was secured into a specialised stretcher and hoisted to the roadway by the Skymed rescue helicopter. "He has been transported to hospital by EMS ambulance in a stable condition. "Police have opened an investigation into the accident and to determine the cause of the accident," Lambinon  said. eNCA
