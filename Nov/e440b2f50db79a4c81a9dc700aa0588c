JOHANNESBURG - The Mail and Guardian is reporting that President Jacob Zuma will appear before the ANC’s integrity commission.
	
	A date has apparently been set for 3 December. It’s understood that Zuma will be questioned on the ruling that he violated the Constitution in his handling of the Nkandla matter, as well as the State of Capture report which questions his involvement in government contracts obtained by the Gupta family. The commission consist of party veterans and has the power to independently act against ANC members who bring the party into disrepute. Its chairperson Andrew Mlangeni and other senior stalwarts have spoken out against Zuma. Earlier this month, ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe criticised the commission for failing to act against Zuma. "Has the integrity commission ever called the president to appear before it? No, I can tell you the answer, they never! They never called him. "They’ve met the officials, we had a general discussion, but the integrity commission has never called the president, not once.” eNCA
