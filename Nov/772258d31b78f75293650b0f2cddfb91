JOHANNESBURG - Johannesburg emergency services have sent out more people to search for a three-year-old girl who was swept away by flood water in Alexandra, Johannesburg. On Wednesday, Everite Chauke's father climbed a tree with her to get away from the water, but the branch snapped and she fell into the torrent.
