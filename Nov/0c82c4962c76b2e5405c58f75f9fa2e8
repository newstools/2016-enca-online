JOHANNESBURG – South Sudan President Salva Kiir has granted amnesty to hundreds of followers of his arch rival, former First Vice President and opposition leader, Dr Riek Machar. However, Machar, the leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLA-IO) who is currently in South Africa, will not be allowed to return unless he renounces violence. READ: South Sudan opposition fractured by infighting According to a report in the Sudan Tribune, those pardoned crossed into neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) when fighting erupted in the capital, Juba in July this year. South Sudan’s Defence Minister Kuol Manyang said Juba was ready to welcome the armed opposition forces residing in refugee camps in DRC. “The President of the Republic has offered an amnesty to those who are ready to come back and this is the message we are sending to the authorities in DRC,” Manyang told the Dawn newspaper. Manyang added that a team would be sent to convey the amnesty offer to the rebels, whose leader declared armed resistance against Kiir in September. “Those who want to return will be sent to containment sites where they will be screened. And those who wish to join the police, will be re-trained,” added the minister. Violence broke out in South Sudan’s capital in July when the two rival forces clashed, leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced. The incident forced Machar to flee Juba into the DRC.
