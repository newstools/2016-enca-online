JOHANNESBURG - The Nelson Mandela Foundation has called for a national convention to help solve the country's current problems. It said it was worried about the weakening of institutions such as the South African Revenue Service, the National Prosecution Authority and other law enforcement bodies. The foundation said this was due to political meddling for private interests. In a strongly worded statement, it also lashed out at President Jacob Zuma for failing the country. READ: Zuma, ministers in court to stop state capture report The foundation said that the unanimous Constitutional Court judgment on the issue of Nkandla showed that he had failed in his commitment and ability as head of state. “The ability and commitment of the head of state to be a ‘constitutional being’ is one of the wheels of our state,” the foundation said in a statement. “The unanimous judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Republic in the matter of President Zuma and the use of state resources on a private residence was one such test. It is increasingly a national consensus that he has failed the test. “As this particular wheel rolls away, other critical institutions of state break off to follow it. The legislative, business, and public service sectors of the country are severely affected, compromising the ability of the state to serve the people. “A battle now rages to keep SARS attached to the vehicle of state. What public discourse has described as ‘state capture’ by private and political interests is, we believe, a real threat to the Republic.” The foundation called on the ANC to take remedial acttions to ensure that the administration was protected and placed in safe and capable hands. eNCA
