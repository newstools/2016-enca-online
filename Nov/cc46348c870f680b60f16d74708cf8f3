JOHANNESBURG – The Hawks have arrested an awaiting trial prisoner who allegedly shot and killed a police officer before escaping from the Tembisa Magistrate's Court. Joshua Bomba Shongwane, 30, was found on Monday in Eersterus, Pretoria in possession of a hijacked car. Shongwane was due to appear in the Tembisa Magistrate's Court on Tuesday, to face murder and hijacking charges among others. Last month, Shongwane held up three police officers in a court holding cell. Police said he took the cell's keys, locked the officers inside, shot a police captain and escaped. He was held for nine hijackings committed in Tembisa, Rabie Ridge and Kagiso during 2012.
