CAPE TOWN - Cabinet called for the country to put up a united front to protect the country’s investment grade status just weeks before ratings agencies determine whether the country will be downgraded to junk status or maintain its rating. Briefing journalists in Parliament a day after cabinet held its fortnightly meeting, Radebe reminded South Africans that Moody’s, Fitch and Standard and Poor will make their decisions over the coming weeks.
