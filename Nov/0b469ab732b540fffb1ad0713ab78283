JOHANNESBURG - The parliamentary inquiry committee into the SABC board's fitness said they are prepared to continue their work despite missing documents, absent witnesses and legal challenges. Committee Chairperson, Vincent Smith said summonses were sent to the national broadcaster for documents but they still have not arrived and a number of listed witnesses will not be able to attend the hearing because they will be travelling. SABC board member Mbulaheni Maguvhe applied for an interdict to have inquiry stopped. Maguvhe is the only remaining SABC board member, the other eight members have resigned. Smith said on Tuesday that he is confident the court will rule in the committee's favour.

The court is expected to make a decision on Friday. The meeting held on Tuesday was described as a "preparatory meeting not an inquiry" by Smith on Tuesday. MPs asked that once the inquiry begins, no witness interviews be held in camera. Smith declared that once court proceedings concluded they would be ready to proceed within 24 hours. eNCA
