JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court said the ruling that Jacobus Kruger be reinstated is unreasonable and must be set aside. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng dismissed Kruger's argument that he's a pastor and has black friends. Kruger called his supervisor the k-word in 2007 during a heated argument. He was taken to a disciplinary hearing where he pleaded guilty, saying stress had led to his racist outbursts. He was initially given a final written warning and suspended without pay for ten days.

BREAKING: Concourt rules that Kruger receive the six months salary initially offered to him by SARS #SARSRacism SARS had to justify overturning the sanction to dismissal or explain that the relationship was irreparably harmed. But it failed to do that. Kruger took his dismissal to the CCMA where he won. SARS lost its subsequent appeals in the Labour Court and argued the case before the Constitutional Court in August. The revenue service maintains it cannot be expected to retain an employee in whom it had lost faith and confidence. eNCA
