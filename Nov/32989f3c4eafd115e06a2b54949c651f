PRETORIA - Oscar Pistorius has moved from the Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in central Pretoria to the nearby Atteridgeville Correctional Centre, which recently installed bathtubs for disabled inmates. READ: State to appeal Oscar Pistorius sentence Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo said Pistorius was transferred the centre earlier in November, which is used to accommodate offenders sentenced up to 6 years. It also has rehabilitation and development programmes that are not available at Kgosi Mampuru II Remand Detention Centre. "Since his incarceration, Pistorius was placed at the Remand Detention Centre which is used to accommodate awaiting trial and sentenced offenders who need full time hospitalisation or health care.  This was done in order to accommodate his disability needs. However, the Remand Detention Centre does not have rehabilitation and development programmes necessary for sentenced offenders as it is strictly designed for awaiting trial detainees. Nxumalo said plans to upgrade the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre began in May, in order to acommodate disabled prisoners. "These upgrades were not strictly made for Mr Pistorius, but to accommodate disabled offenders under Kgosi Mampuru II Management Area. Furthermore, the upgrades were done long before the management considered moving Mr Pistorius to Atteridgeville." Nxumalo said the move would enable Pistorius to attend rehabilitation programmes, specific to his needs. Pistorius is serving a six-year prison term for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013. eNCA
