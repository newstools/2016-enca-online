JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma told supporters on Saturday that he wasn't scared to go to prison because he had been incarcerated during apartheid. This was during his first public appearance since the release of an anti-corruption report critical of him. WATCH: Zuma takes swipe at critics "I'm not scared of jail. I've been to jail during the struggle," Zuma told a cheering crowd in his home Kwa-Zulu Natal province. In a report released last week as thousands of protesters called for the president to step down, South Africa's anti-graft watchdog called for a judge to investigate allegations of influence-peddling in Zuma's government. Zuma denies providing special favours for wealthy friends. Earlier on Saturday, at the rally, ANC NEC member, Nomvula Mokonyane, didn't see any reason for the president to deal with the recent revelations in the state of capture report and said she sees no reason for Zuma to step down. "The president of the ANC has been put to the position through the structures...I see no reason for us to have calls outside of the processes to call for his resignation." "Those who love the ANC dear, understand ANC processes." "I think we should accept that President JZ should be given an opportunity to take the ANC to the next elections."
