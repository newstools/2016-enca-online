JOHANNESBURG â€“ Auditor-General Kimi Makwetu said on Wednesday that irregular expenditure at government departments and entities cost South African taxpayers a whopping R46.3-billion for 2015-2016. This is more than the cost of the Gautrain (R30-billion) or 180 Nkandla homesteads (at a cost of R248-million each). WATCH: AG releases state expenditure report If you divide this amount by the most recent population statistics for South Africa, 54.9 million, this works out to just over R800 per person. Hypotheticaly, if you were the finance minister, and you had an extra R800 to allocate to one of the important areas of need in the country what would you choose? Vote in the poll below: eNCA
