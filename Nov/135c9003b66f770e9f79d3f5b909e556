He said, "No, but there is a shebeen there, I think it is two streets away from the Gupta house.” Noting #SaxonwoldShebeen as one of the hidden gems of Jozi^TK pic.twitter.com/AdkL8NIRoj Saxonwold & Parkwood Residents Association Chairperson, Tessa Turvey dismissed the claim saying, "As far as shebeen is defined in the dictionary. There is no shebeen in Saxonwold. The Guptas are two streets from where we are now, which is where Molefe says the shebeen is. I don’t know what they could be talking about seriously. There is nothing that could be construed as a shebeen, as far as I know, in Saxonwold.” When you see your drinks bill at the #SaxonwoldShebeen pic.twitter.com/ZN01MdXe97 eNCA
