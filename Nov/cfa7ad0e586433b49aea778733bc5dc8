READ: More heavy rains expected for Thursday The rain returned on Thursday afternoon with strong winds and hail in some areas of Gauteng, while people attempted to recover from flooding the day before. The Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA) called on road users to exercise caution and patience when travelling. A number of bridges have been reported flooded or collapsed as a result of yesterday`s heavy rain. In a statement, the JRA said: "Flash floods occur within few minutes or hours of excessive rainfall. This may be caused by a dam failure or a severe and heavy rainstorm. "Nearly half of all flash flood deaths are auto- (car) related, so never drive or let anyone drive through flood waters. "Roads could be washed out under the strong currents. And if your car stalls in just two feet (61cm) of moving water, the water will have enough force to lift up your car and carry it away." Mayoral Member Committee for Transport Nonhlanhla Makhuba urged motorists to obey road signs, traffic signals and road closures due to flooded bridges or unsafe driving conditions which are unsafe. Residents and road users are encouraged to report all road- and storm-related emergencies to 0860 562 874/ hotline@jra.org.za / twitter @MyJra or the JRA Find&Fix mobile app. eNCA
