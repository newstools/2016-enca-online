JOHANNESBURG –  Petrol is set to drop by about 41 cents a litre for December, diesel by 38 cents and illuminating paraffin by 36 cents, according to the Automobile Association (AA). Commenting on unaudited month-end fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund,  the AA said the rand had regained some of the sharp losses suffered in the wake of Donald Trump's election as the next US president. "Over the same period, international petroleum prices enjoyed a brief rally before heading lower. As a result, the likely decline in the fuel price will be similar to what was indicated in mid-November", the association continued. READ: Petrol price up from Wednesday The AA further explained that "future movements of the rand and international petroleum prices have become very complex to anticipate, and since these factors are the chief drivers of the price we pay at the pumps, South Africans should be cautious about hoping for further fuel price drops." "A host of highly fluid factors are at play, including local political developments, ratings agencies' view of our economy, and the impact of possible changes in US policy after Trump takes office. We expect this volatility to be reflected in fuel prices in the next few months," the association concluded. - eNCA/Alexandra Willis eNCA
