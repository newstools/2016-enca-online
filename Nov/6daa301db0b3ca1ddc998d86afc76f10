JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Premier David Makhura said on Friday he intended to declare some parts of Gauteng disaster areas following this week’s fierce flash floods in the province. “We are taking the necessary steps to declare a disaster so that we can tap into all available resources to assist those affected by the flash floods and ongoing heavy downpours to rebuild their lives,” Makhura said in a statement. This comes after the City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metro both experienced floods on Wednesday that killed at least six people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes and cars. Makhura, who was attending the International Investment Conference in Namibia at the time, received a report from MEC for Human Settlement Paul Mashatile on the casualties and scale of the damage.

The provincial government has urged Gauteng residents to be extra cautious this weekend as more floods were anticipated. The South African Weather Services has issued another warning of heavy storms during the weekend until at least Sunday as heavy rain fall was expected throughout the country. African News Agency
