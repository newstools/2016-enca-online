JOHANNESBURG - The rand strengthened against hard global currencies on Monday afternoon ahead of the US presidential elections on Tuesday. The markets welcomed the FBI’s decision to close the investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. This has increased Clinton’s chances of wining the presidential race over republican Donald Trump. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Celeste Fauconnier said a risk-on relief rally in global assets could be expected if the election went as expected. The chances of Clinton winning the election were now at 83%‚ she said. NKC Research analyst Hanns Spangenberg said a possible victory for Republican Donald Trump was seen as adverse for the markets and could result in a further postponement of an increase of higher US interest rates. At the Federal Open Market Committee meeting last week the US Federal Reserve bank kept interest rates on hold‚ as expected. At 15.30pm‚ the rand was at R13.4814 to the dollar from Friday’s R13.5350. It was at R14.9118 to the euro from R15.0033 and R16.7585 to the pound from R16.8965 The euro was at $1.1060‚ from $1.1063. iNet Bridge
