BLOEMFONTEIN - Assisted suicide and euthanasia was back in the spotlight on Friday as the Supreme Court of Appeal heard arguments in the right to die case of the late Robin Stransham-Ford. Judgment in the case was reserved on Friday. Last year, the North Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of Stransham-Fordâ€™s application to allow a doctor to help him end his life and also declared that the doctor who did so would not be acting illegally. The Health Professions Council of SA, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Justice and the Director of Public Prosecutions are all appealing the ruling, arguing that the Constitution guarantees the right to life, not death. Earlier this year, Archbishop Emeritus, Desmond Tutu, said terminally ill people should have right to choose a dignified assisted death.
