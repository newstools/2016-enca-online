JOHANNESBURG - The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) has announced it's unhappiness over Brian Molefe's resignation as Eskom's CEO. NUM said the move was premature, adding that Molefe should have awaited for the outcome of a commission of inquiry into state capture before resigning. READ: I have done nothing wrong, says Brian Molefe as he steps down The union reacted following Molefe's announcement on Friday, saying it was concerned because it felt the power producer was starting to stabilise under Molefe's leadership. NUM's former Mpumalanga Branch Secretary, Mxolisi Hoboyi caused a stir in the union's ranks when he questioned the wisdom of these remarks, via eNCA. Hoboyi told eNCA he represents workers at the Optimum Coal Mine and Eskom's Arnot Power Station in Mpumalanga, and was angered by the statement by the union's national office. He highlighted the fact that a total of 2,000 workers lost jobs when Optimum Coal was forced to go into business rescue, shortly after the Gupta takeover of the mine.
