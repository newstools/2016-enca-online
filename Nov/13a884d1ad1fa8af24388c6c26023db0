LIMPOPO - Prophet (Detective) Lethebo Rabalago from the Mountzion General Assembly in Limpopo uses Doom insect killer to heal people. He commands demons to enter into people's bodies so that they can manifest, "for demons need flesh in order for them to operate". According to the church's Facebook page, prophet Rabalago "begins to speak to demons in order to address problems people face each day. He then drives them out of their bodies to free the people."
