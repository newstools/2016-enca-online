JOHANNESBURG – As you read this, the Hexagon is being welded together and the ink is drying on the very last few tickets available for EFC 55 at GrandWest Casino in Goodwood, Cape Town on the 11th of November and what better person to whet the appetites of destruction than Extreme Fighting Championships very own matchmaker, Graeme Cartmell. Recorded just before today’s shock announcement of Don Madge’s withdrawal due to injury and Leon Mynhardt’s incredible replacement opportunity, messrs Stephens and Cartmell break down every single bout on the card, from the early doors prelims to the semtex-fest of Demarte Pena vs Irshaad Sayed, a fight that will shape the bantamweight division for years to come. Welcome, to The Clinch. * Watch the interview in the gallery above, or listen to the podcast below. eNCA
