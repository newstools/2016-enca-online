JOHANNESBURG - Shakes Mashaba has had an uneasy relationship with members of the media and his employees at the South African Football Association (Safa) from the beginning of his tenure as the head coach of Bafana Bafana. According to Safa's website “Mashaba will not join the team on their trip to Mozambique as the Association has deemed it necessary to employ disciplinary measures after a regrettable incident at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.” Bafana's assistant coach Owen da Gama took charge of the team's international friendly match against Mozambique on Tuesday in Maputo where they drew 1-1. The team beat Senegal 2-1 on Saturday in a 2018 World Cup qualifying round. eNCA
