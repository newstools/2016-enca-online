SEBOKENG, Gauteng - The South African Communist Party in Gauteng hosted its leg of the Red October Campaign on Sunday. The rally was held under the banner “Reclaim our townships and villages, intensify mobilisation for our revolutionary democratic transformation”. SACP Secretary General Blade Nzimande raised questions about the motive behind some of the Hawks' investigations that was raised in the Sunday Times newspaper earlier on Sunday. UPDATE: Hawks deny probing top ANC leaders "We have to defend our country and we are to stand up as the SACP." "But comrades, we to go deeper into who is behind this. Who is behind the Hawks doing this things they are doing. Do those people have an interest in the kind of SA that Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Chris Hani fought for. I don’t think so. I think there’s something seriously fishy." Nzimande says third forces are behind the Hawks investigation into the finance minister. "We know who’s chasing Pravi. We know and we’ve got more details as the SACP about why Pravin is being chased." "Now it’s Gwede. We know who’s doing that and what the reasons are. But because we don’t want to burn this country, we’ll have to handle that information differently." Nzimande says the Gupta family has undermined the freedom of the country. "Who is this Gupta family with such entitlement. We have illustrious families in SA. The Mandela family, The Kathradas, Sisulu’s and many others who have no culture of entitlement. Why is this family feeling that it has a culture of entitlement to do as it wishes in our country and land their plane at Waterkloof. It surely can’t be." eNCA
