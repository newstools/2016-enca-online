CAPE TOWN - Torture and assault of prison inmates has been exposed in CCTV footage. The prison's oversight body, the Judicial Inspectorate of Correctional Services, released it at a seminar in the Western Cape. Newly-appointed Inspecting Judge Johan van der Westhuizen had harsh words for the poor investigation by officials into violent incidences in prisons. The Constitutional Court judge says he is shocked by the footage captured in 2015 at the Brandvlei Correctional Centre. eNCA reporter Aarti Narsee has more on the story in the video gallery above. eNCA
