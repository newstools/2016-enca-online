GUADALUPE ISLAND - A diver who was filming under water escaped unharmed after a great white shark pushed its way into the cage. Video footage has emerged showing the shark biting onto a chunk of tuna which was attached to a rope.  The person who posted the footage onto YouTube said, "when a great white shark lunges and bites something, it is temporarily blinded. They also cannot swim backwards. So this shark lunged at the bait, accidentally hit the side of the cage, was most likely confused and not able to swim backwards, it thrust forward and broke the metal rail of the cage." A diver, who was described as being a very experienced dive instructor, was inside the cage and "ended up outside the bottom of the cage, looking down on two great white sharks".  The shark thrashed about the cage and eventually managed to get out, allowing the diver to climb out uninjured.  The author of the post ended by saying, "everyone on the boat returned to the cages the next day, realizing this was a very rare event. The boat owner, captain, and crew are to be commended for making what could've been a tragic event into a happy ending". YouTube
