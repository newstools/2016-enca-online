JOHANNESBURG - The meeting between management and students at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) originally set for Friday, and then shifted to Saturday, has been postponed until Monday. This followed clashes between students and security guards at CPUT's Bellville campus. The meeting was initially to take place without students, but the gathering was disrupted when protesting students demanded to be part of discussions. The meeting will now encompass "all stakeholders". eNCA
