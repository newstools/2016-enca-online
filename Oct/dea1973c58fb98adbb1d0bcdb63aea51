JOHANNESBURG - Parliament says it will be returning the Public Protector's final report to her office. Earlier, Thuli Madonsela wrote to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete, asking her to keep the report safe. In a statement, Mbete says she's obliged to table all documents received for the information of members, to ensure the business of parliament is conducted in an open and transparent manner. But she says this report can't be handled in the same way. eNCA
