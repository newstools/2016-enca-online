JOHANNESBURG – President Jacob Zuma is one step closer to being charged with fraud and corruption. The Constitutional Court has dismissed the National Prosecuting Authority's request for leave to appeal a ruling that the decision not to prosecute Zuma was irrational. Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga said in a statement: "The president awaits the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in respect of a petition which he launched on the same matter." But his legal options are running out. For the past six years, the DA has been fighting to give the president his day in court. Zuma faced 783 corruption, fraud and racketeering charges which were controversially dropped in 2009, paving the way for him to take office.

It is one step closer to the end of this saga. There is one more appeal sitting with the SCA. We will give Mr Zuma what he’s been asking for, which is his day in court,” said DA federal chairperson, James Selfe. Zuma has applied for leave to appeal the matter in the Supreme Court of Appeal. But a constitutional law expert said it is unlikely that court will agree to hear him. eNCA
