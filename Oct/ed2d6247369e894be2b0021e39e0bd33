CAPE TOWN – The Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has announced an 8 percent increase for next year to the students who can afford it. CPUT Vice Chancellor Prins Nevhutalu made the announcement on Friday at a general assembly meeting of staff and students hosted at their Bellville campus. Nevhutalu said most of their students either qualified for financing from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) or fell into the "missing middle" category. “Since the bulk of students studying at CPUT fall within the above two categories, the practical implication for them is that the fees they will pay next year will be the same as what they paid in 2015. The only students who will be required to pay the increase will be those students who come from households where the joint income is above R600,000 per annum,” said Nevhutalu. CPUT's announcement follows Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande's fee announcement in which he asked universities not to increase fees by not more than 8 percent next year. “While no firm resolutions were taken, we are pleased that both staff and students showed that an engagement of this kind is possible. Classes remain suspended although the university is open,” the university said in a statement. WATCH: Fees commission must be allowed to finish its work Nevhutalu asked students to stop the disruptions. “So far, the CPUT management have been very tolerant to the disruptive and in some cases illegal behaviour of a very small group of students. I appeal to these students to please stop this kind of behaviour,” Nevhutalu said. “While our constitution affords students the right to peaceful protest, it does not give them the right to disrupt the activities of others and more specifically their right to be in class and not to be disrupted or removed from class by force,” he added. He urged student leaders to ensure that there is no further disruptions or acts of intimidation. eNCA
