The governing party says it’s working steadily towards implementing free education for those who cannot afford to pay. ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe said, "People say there’ll free education, no, that’s not what the freedom charter says." "The freedom charter says higher education and technical training shall be opened to all. That’s the right to it, by means of state allowance and scholarship on the basis of merit, the right is open, but access is on the basis of merit." "We have been hard at work to ensure the progressive realisation of this project.” WATCH: ANC NEC briefing eNCA
