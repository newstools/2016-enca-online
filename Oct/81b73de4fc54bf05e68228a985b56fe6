JOHANNESBURG - The film A United Kingdom has premiered in Botswana as the country celebrates its independence. The film follows Botswana’s first president Sir Seretse Khama and his British wife Ruth Williams. It’s widely regarded as one of the great love stories of all time. Studying law, Khama falls for English insurance clerk Williams. The two cause an international outcry when they marry in 1948. There's opposition from family, local leaders, as well as from the British and some Southern African governments. The film was well received when it premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. It's now the continent's turn and comes at an opportune time. A United Kingdom will be released in South Africa, Botswana and East and West Africa in December. * Watch the video in the gallery above. eNCA
