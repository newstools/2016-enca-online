JOHANNESBURG -- No one from the African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee will be resigning, as it would be cowardly and unwise. That was the ANCs position after its parliamentary leader Jackson Mthembu called on its entire NEC to resign. "It would be extremely irresponsible and cowardice for the NEC to resign when they are elected by the structures they account to. (They) can't resign without accounting to the structures and the conference that elected them," spokesperson Zizi Kodwa told eNCA on Sunday afternoon. WATCH: 'Everybody must step down, including President Zuma' - Mthembu Kodwa said it was not the first time Mthembu raised such concerns. Mthmebu had spoken out at a four-day NEC meeting, where he called for the party's leadership to take the collective fall. "Personal views must be raised within the structures. Its correct that Jacksonâ€™s concerns were raised in several meetings," Kodwa said in response to a question of the party's effectiveness in dealing with members' grievances internally. He called on party members to refrain from making personal opinions concerning the party outside its structures. Mthembu, the Chief Whip, called on all ANC executive leadership to step down and slammed the use of state organs to settle political scores, with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan now facing fraud charges. Mthembu said he'd been silent for too long, and the time had come for the ANC to make some changes. eNCA
