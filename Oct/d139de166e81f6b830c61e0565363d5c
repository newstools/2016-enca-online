JOHANNESBURG - President Jacob Zuma has asked a court to postpone a hearing scheduled for 1 November when his application to delay the release of a report over allegations of political influence was due to be heard. The Presidency's spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said Zuma's lawyers wrote to the court on Thursday, saying he wants the investigation to be re-opened so that he can question witnesses himself and give evidence before it is finalised. The Public Protector, a constitutionally-mandated anti-graft watchdog, said on Wednesday that the investigation had been finalised. Ngqulunga said when Zuma had filed his original application it was not made clear the investigation had finished. "If it is final, then it changes the ball game a little. So the president now wants the investigation to be re-opened, so that he can answer any questions and make his own representations, before it is finalised," he said. Ngqulunga said the decision on whether to delay the hearing had not yet been made by the court. The main opposition Democratic Alliance party said it would challenge Zuma's request for a postponement, to avoid South Africans being subjected to "President Zuma's political games and 11th hour interventions".
