JOHANNESBURG - Two members of #UKZN's academic staff and students have been arrested. They'd been at a small gathering to discuss #FeesMustFall. One of the arrested staff members threatened to sue the SAPS, saying UKZN interdict only applies to students, not the staff as well. Lecturer Clint Le Bruyns says he and his colleague were later released on a warning. A few students, meanwhile, started throwing rocks at police gathered on campus. At least 6 students are reported to have been arrested on Monday morning. Follow the live blog below: eNCA
