JOHANNESBURG - More than 200 branches of the Post Office have closed down. The organisation recorded losses of more than R1-billion in the year ending March 2016. Revenue also dropped by 9-percent, following the R1.4-billion loss for the 2015 financial year. Post Office branches had to close due to outstanding rentals, while some even had to operate without paper, printer toner and other necessities.

CEO, Mark Barnes, expects the 2016 / 17 financial year also to be tough, predicting that losses may even exceed those reported this year. Revenue has come under pressure due to non-payment by debtors, and a lack of investment in new technology. The Democratic Alliance has now weighed in on the saga, saying the Post Office urgently needs to introduce profitable, public-private partnerships to core parts of the business like the Postbank, courier and parcel services. The DA says if this doesn't happen, funds will dry up, and the organisation will have to turn to government for more bailouts. eNCA
