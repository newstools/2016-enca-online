JOHANNESBURG â€“ Treasury says it has no intention of fighting the Gupta case in the court of public opinion. It was responding to Oakbay Resources' move to respond to the finance minister's affidavit in public. AUDIO: No need for Gordhan to make representations "It is peculiar in the extreme for the aforementioned respondents to address the issues raised in the affidavit by way of media releases as these make no meaningful contribution to the case at hand. The Minister has presented his case under oath in an appropriate forum and it is incumbent upon the Oakbay respondents to do likewise should they wish to oppose his version," National Treasury said in a statement. READ: Gordhan feeling 'emotionally tired'
		
		In a statement, the treasury said it welcomed the company's announcement that it will defend the matter in court. This follows the Gupta family's unsuccessful attempt to coerce the minister into withdrawing the matter. Pravin Gordhan claimed in his affidavit that Oakbay was seeking to harm the banking and financial sectors. The family then asked him to intervene after some of the country's banks decided not to do business with the company. eNCA
