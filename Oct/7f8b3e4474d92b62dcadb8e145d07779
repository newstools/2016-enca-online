JOHANNESBURG - The JSE opened marginally weaker on Wednesday as banks retreated for the second straight session after fraud charges were laid against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan on Tuesday. Industrials and gold shares were early morning gainers. The weaker rand lifted some rand hedges but the market mood was cautious amid reports that Gordhan may still be charged on matters relating to the “rogue unit” at SARS‚ which is being investigated by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). A defiant Gordhan on Tuesday accused National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shaun Abrahams of being disingenuous in his handling of the fraud matter and said the charges were politically motivated. The rand’s weakness increased the possibility of a downgrade of SA’s sovereign debt rating‚ affecting investor confidence in the country.
