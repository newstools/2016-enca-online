JOHANNESBURG – The EFF is planning a mass protest in Pretoria early in November. Party leader Julius Malema called on South Africans to participate and defend the country’s democracy. “The protest action on the 2nd of November 2016 will be unapologetically demanding the following: that the South African government must provide free quality education at higher education from 2017 onwards; that Jacob Zuma must immediately step down as president and head of state in SA; Guptas must be disconnected from all state contracts and must immediately leave South Africa; Shawn Abrahams the NDPP of Jacob Zuma must immediately step down from The National Prosecuting Authority,” he said. FULL INTERVIEW: Checkpoint: Malema wants a political merger Malema said businesses in the capital that remained open may not be safe during the protest march in November and promised that the EFF was going to take action. “You have to come to the streets, you have done it through a vote, you are still not listening. Maybe the only thing they will listen is a militant action on the second of November in Pretoria. Every street in Pretoria must be occupied. We cannot guarantee the safety of businesses on that say and therefore we will advise them to shut down their businesses because it's now time for South Africans to take action,” Malema said. Guptas abusing state resources Malema said government and the controversial Gupta family were abusing state resources to force out Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. “The Gupta’s and Jacob Zuma have realised that the Public Protector will expose their dodgy dealings and as part of their fight-back plan, use the NPA to charge the incumbent Minister of Finance, force him into resignation or reshuffle him with the aim of capturing the National Treasury,” he said. eNCA
