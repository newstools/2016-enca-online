JOHANNESBURG - The official opposition, Democratic Alliance, approached the courts on Friday to challenge the notice of withdrawal to the International Criminal Court on Thursday as unconstitutional, irrational and procedurally flawed. In a notice to the United Nations on Thursday, government says it’s obligations with respect to the peaceful resolution of conflicts, are incompatible with the interpretations given by the ICC. South Africa’s withdrawal will take effect a year after the United Nations Secretary General receives notification from government.

South Africa said at the time that diplomatic immunity for heads of state over-ruled its legal oblilgation to arrest Bashir under the ICC. However, there does appear to be conflicting views as to whether there needs to be parliamentary approval to withdraw from international treaties. The notice delivered by South Africa to the United Nations, labelled “Instrument of Withdrawal”, was signed by International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane on Wednesday. eNCA
