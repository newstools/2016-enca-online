JOHANNESBURG - The Constitutional Court has refused to hear the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA) appeal on the judgement which reinstated fraud, racketeering and corruption charges against President Jacob Zuma, the Democratic Alliance said on Friday. “This highlights, yet again, the deliberate attempts by the NPA and Jacob Zuma to do everything possible to delay Jacob Zuma having his day in court”, said James Selfe, chairperson of the DA's federal executive. In late April 2016, a full bench of the North Gauteng High Court ruled that former National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Head, Mokotedi Mpshe's decision not to pursue 783 charges of corruption, fraud and racketeering, against Zuma was irrational. According to the statement, the DA argued that there are no reasonable prospects of success nor are there any other compelling reasons why the appeal should be heard. “The full bench of the North Gauteng High Court fully ventilated the issues and they too came to the determination that an appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) would be unsuccessful”, Selfe added. eNCA
