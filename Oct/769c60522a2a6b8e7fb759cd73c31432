* Editor's note: This article has been updated with additional information. CAPE TOWN - The University of the Western Cape has suspended face-to-face lectures lectures, citing the recent protests. In a statement it said: "After serious consideration of the national situation, and the uncertainty around the stability and safety on our campus, we have convened an urgent Special Meeting of the Senate Executive Committee to consider the way forward that will allow us to complete the 2016 academic year. "Today (Wednesday) the situation on campus escalated and it has become clear that simply continuing with face-to-face academic engagement would not be possible without seriously compromising the safety of students and staff."

They were responding to a memorandum of demands issued by students earlier this month. Among their list of demands, students called for free quality decolonised education, no-fee increases and the scrapping of all student debt. The university says while it supports the call for free education for the poor, it can't afford not to increase fees in 2017. It also says it's unable to write off the historical student debt without financial assistance from the state. UWC management says it's committed to the development of black academics, and plans to recruit more black professors in the near future. eNCA
