JOHANNESBURG – South Sudan’s former deputy president Riek Machar, is in South Africa for medical treatment. The department of international relations (Dirco) confirmed his arrival but said it does not know how long Machar will be in the country. Machar fled South Sudan in July 2016 amid violence that killed more than 300 people and forced 60, 000 civilians to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.

Machar and President Salva Kiir formed a transitional government in April after more than two years of feuding between the two men had erupted into war. But by July, Taban Deng Gai took over as acting first vice president while Machar was in hiding. Kiir had said the appointment was temporary until Machar's return. eNCA
