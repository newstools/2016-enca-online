CAPE TOWN - The fight for free tertiary education has turned into protests for regime change and have echoes of Marikana. That’s according to Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande. “This is no longer about fees anymore. This is about trying to cause discontent. It’s about regime change, to be quite honest," said Nzimande. Nzimande said the #FeesMustFall protest movement began as a legitimate concern, but is now really about removing President Jacob Zuma and his cabinet.
