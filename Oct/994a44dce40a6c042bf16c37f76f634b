JOHANNESBURG -  New Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane said she would not oppose President Jacob Zuma's interdict against the release of the 'State Capture' report. Mkhwebane, in court papers, also revealed that she had withdrawn opposition to cooperative governance Des van Rooyen's application with regard to the same matter. On Tuesday, Parliament confirmed that it had sent the 'State Capture' report to Mkhwebane, who began her tenure on Monday. In the court papers, Mkhwebane said she was not in a position to advocate for the report's release nor grant Van Rooyen and Zuma additional time to make representations. The President's notice of application to interdict the report will be heard in the North Gauteng High Court. The report that was due to be made public by Thuli Madonsela last Friday was not released when the presidency launched an urgent court bid. On her first day in office, Mkhwebane would not be drawn into commenting on the report, but said she was preparing a responding affidavit that was due in court on Friday. She confirmed that it was being kept secure in a safe in the Legal Services Office of Public Protector House in Pretoria. The potentially explosive report was expected to reveal details of the Gupta family’s involvement in allegedly influencing the appointment of Cabinet members. eNCA's Karyn Maughan has confirmed that Co-operative Government Minister Des van Rooyen has withdrawn his interdict as he believes the report has made no adverse findings against him. eNCA
