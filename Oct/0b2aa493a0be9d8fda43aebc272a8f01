JOHANNESBURG – A company, reportedly linked to the Guptas, has rubbished a story in the Sunday Times about state capture.
	
	The newspaper reported that the CEO of Trillian Capital briefed some of the company's top executives about former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene's axing, several weeks before it was made public.

But Trillian hit back and said the Guptas had no shareholding or interest in the company. The company also said the so-called whistleblower was a disgruntled former employee who faces criminal prosecution. Trillian also claimed the Sunday Times did not give it enough time to respond to questions and that it reserves its legal rights.
