Just this year two children lost their lives to drugs following a house party in KwaMashu. We welcome this bold and progressive step by SABC management,” said Thusi. The MEC has called on artists to become activists and use their craft to spread positive messages. “Artists have a huge role to play in building our communities and ensuring social cohesion. Radio stations also need to assist in ensuring that songs that are not contributing positively towards nation-building are not given airtime,” Thusi said. eNCA
