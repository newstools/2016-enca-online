JOHANNESBURG – The mother of a 14-month old abducted during a house robbery in Protea Glen has thanked the media and police after her son was found unharmed. The boy, Siya Mlambo, was found on Thursday night in Madadeni, Newcastle in KwaZulu-Natal. “I would like to thank my family and friends for the support," said Mandisa Mlambo. "I would also like to thank the media. If it wasn't for you, we would not have found our son. Most of all I would like to thank the SAPS for putting so much effort into solving this mystery for us,” she said. Major General Kekana of the Soweto West SAPS cluster said Mandisa and her child's nanny were robbed of their cellphones during the robbery. The suspects demanded car keys and left with the nanny to withdraw money from an ATM. They kept the women hostage for the night and left the next day with the baby.
