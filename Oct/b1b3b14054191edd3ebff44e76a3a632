JOHANNESBURG - In an interview after a number of protests at Wits university on Tuesday, vice chancellor Adam Habib says some of the students' demands are beyond the university’s means. “Free education cannot be given by Wits University." "It has to be given effectively by government itself. You are subtly fighting the 2016 academic year program for no reason because we can’t deliver these goals." "We are trying to get on with the academic programme. We will continue to do so." "Seventeen universities closed in this country. If we don’t turn the corner soon, we will destroy South African higher education and we will destroy the economy itself”. Earlier on Tuesday, Habib warned of serious consequences if classes didn't resume this morning.

He has repeated his call for academic activities to continue. "The protestors number is between 400 and 500 students." "We shouldn't sacrifice the futures of over 35000 students and that's what we've been fighting for this whole day." eNCA
