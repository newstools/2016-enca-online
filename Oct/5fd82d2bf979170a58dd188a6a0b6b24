JOHANNESBURG - SARS has described a report by Mail & Guardian as factually incorrect and malicious. The newspaper suggests that SARS Chief Tom Moyane’s nephew scored a debt collection contract worth millions. But the revenue authority is insisting that each agency was awarded R2.2-billion debt to collect for the Pilot Project. It’s also said that SARS cancelled the tender with debt collector Lekgotla Trifecta Consortium after an investigation. This was done after SARS received a media query alerting it to the relationship between the Tax Commissioner and LTC’s Nhlamulo Ndhlela. The revenue service maintains that it had not been aware of the relationship prior to the query. SARS has further stated that when the tender was awarded, Moyane was not aware that his nephew had been a shareholder in LTC. eNCA
